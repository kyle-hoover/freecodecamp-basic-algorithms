function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  if (str.substr(-target.length) === target)
      //str.substr() will return the characters in a string (str) starting from (beginning, to end). What happens is we check
      the LAST word of the string (str) which is why we added the - before the next part. We then put in target.length, which
      will check from the end of the string up to the length of the target variable. We check if this is equal to the target 
      variable.
    return true;
    else return false;

confirmEnding("Bastian", "ian");

for example, if we put in Bastian and ian as the string and target respectively:
    It will return true
    This is because the negative (-) will tell our function to start at THE END of our function
    Then it will check the length of the target 
    Then (get this) it will count backwards in str to the length of the target and start there and work forwards again
    so in this case, it will start with the word (str) Bastian
    Then it will find the length of the target (ian)
    then it will count backwards in Bastian by the length of ian (3 characters)
    Then it will go forward from there and see if it matches the target ian
      So it starts from Bast -> ian and compares it to ian
      In this case it is true
