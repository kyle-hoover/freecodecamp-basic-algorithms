     than 0, it replaces zero then is compared again to the next number. This in essence gets us the highest number symbolized as n. Then
     we replace the first variable in the array with the value of n (the greatest number). All subsequent arrays do the same thing, just 
     with different variables and different spots in the array.

This is the free code camp solution which is a lot better

function largestOfFour(arr) {
  var results = [];
    //this creates the final array that will store all of our greatest number variables
  
  for (var n = 0; n < arr.length; n++) {
    var largestNumber = arr[n][0];
      //this basically assigns the array results with the first variable from each array
    
    for (var sb = 1; sb < arr[n].length; sb++) {
      //arr[n] is the entire array, arr[n][0] is the first variable in each array
      //this for loop starts at the next variable (variable 1) and runs it against the length of the entire array (arr[n]) 
      if (arr[n][sb] > largestNumber) {
        //this says that if the next number is greater than the largest number we previously had (the first number in each array)
        largestNumber = arr[n][sb];
          //then reassign largestNumber with the new number
      }
    }

    results[n] = largestNumber;
      //this replaces each array with only one number [n], which is equal to the largest number
  }

  return results;
}
